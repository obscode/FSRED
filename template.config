# THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON TWEAKABLE SETTINGS
# OTHER SETTINGS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MAIN fsred.csh SCRIPT and can be added here.  

# COMPUTER SETTINGS:
set BKJOBS = 4         # SET MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SIMULTANEOUS BACKGROUND JOBS 
# IF COMPUTER STARTS PERFORMING SLOWLY, DECREASE BKJOBS.


# INITIAL REDUCTION

set TLATENT = 0.004     # 0 (no latent image masking) | 0.004 = 5.76 minutes after bright source.

# CROWDED FIELDS BACKGROUND INTERPOLATING
set INTERPOLATION = 0   # default = 0 = none | 1-mimsurfit mask | 2-mimsurfit no-mask.  Interpolate sky frame regions with no data or where sources are still detected.
set HISIG = 5           # IF INTERPOLATION is non-zero.  set to a high value for sparse fields, set to a lower value, ie 5 for crowded fields.

# 1st PASS SOURCE MASKING
set HIDETECT = 2        # 1st PASS SOURCE DETECTION, SET -e flag to inspect object mask and vary AREAGROW & HIDETECT as desired.  
set AREAGROW = 0        # (0-X) default = 0.5, if crowded field, decrease to find some sky.

# BACKGROUND FITTING/REMOVAL

set SROWS = 1           # REMOVE CORRELATED READ NOISE FROM ROWS
set SCOLS = 1           # REMOVE CORRELATED READ NOISE FROM COLUMNS

# SCAMP SETTINGS

# COMBINE SETTINGS
set IMCOMBINE = YES     # YES - imcombine | NO - SWARP
set CTYPE = WEIGHTED    # MEDIAN | AVERAGE | WEIGHTED
set REJTYPE = avsigclip # none | minmax | avsigclip | sigclip
set LWEIGHT = 0.0       # (0.0 | X) REJECT THE X fraction of the lower 3/4 quartile, 0.0 = combine everything. 1.0 = combine only the upper quartile weights.   
set PSCALE = 0.16       # OUTPUT PIXEL SCALE
